In order to avoid large files in this git the ycb objects have to be downloaded manually here:
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tHPAQ2aPdkp8cwtFP4gs4wdcP02jfGpH

Please copy the relevant ycb object folders here in the form "003_cracker_box".
After that please replace its "model_normalized.urdf" with the corresponding urdf file from this repository.
